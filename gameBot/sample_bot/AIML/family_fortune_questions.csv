Name a colour;blue;37;red;24;purple;13;NULL
Name a form of transport;bus;46;car;30;train;19;This category brought a diverse range of answers – from hackney carriage and the Shinkansen, to a helicopter, a jet pack, a tram and a unicycle – award yourself an extra point if you said any of those things!
Name a bad job for someone who is accident prone ;window cleaner;32;surgeon;12;builder;9;chef;5;tight rope walker;4;waiter;4;There were some very creative answers in this category – would you have said a Banana Picker, a Stunt Man, a Trapeze Artist or a Glass Blower? If you matched these answers give yourself an extra point
name a breed of dog;Labrador;17;pug;17;Alsatian;9;poodle;9;collie;7;Dalmatian;6;There were lots of breeds nominated in this category, however it’s nice to see that our top dog was voted the nation’s top dog last year – and is America’s top dog this year – Congratulations to the Labrador!
Name an animal that you cant fit in a mini;Elephant;81;Giraffe;17;Blue Whale;7;Rhino;5;Hippo;5;Horse;4;Without a doubt, Elephant was the winner in this category – however one or two prehistoric animals also got a look in – the Sabre Tooth Tiger, a Stegosaurus and even an Argentinosaurus, the largest of the herbivores, which at an estimated 300 metres long, 50+ tonnes in weight probably wouldn’t have even got a tail tip into a mini!  If you named any of these animals – or even the more generic ‘dinosaur’ – award yourself an extra point.
name something made of wool;jumper;73;sheep;20;hat;9;cardigan;6;sweater;5;scarf;4;Something ‘made of wool’ – one of our top six answers may have stretched that definition a little with the answer ‘sheep’ – however the answer that caused the most confusion was definitely ‘Lamb Chops’ – until it was pointed out that this was a popular ventriloquists dummy on television in the 1960s and 70s!
name a bad place to fall asleep;train;17;at work;12;driving;10;train track/train line;6;school;5;The greatest range of answers were definitely to this question – a lot of answers involved being in charge of machinery – whether train, plane or automobile – but 4 people named the toilet and 2 people the House of Commons – although it is doubtful anyone has done much sleeping there in the last few months – and 1 person mentioned an exam hall, hopefully not from personal experience!
name a car brand;Ford;25;Audi;13;Volvo;13;Mini;10;Toyota;10;BMW;6;NULL
name a famous scientist;Einstein;53;Curie;36;Newton;14;Hawking;7;Feynman;3;Pasteur;3;Definitely one of our favourite categories, with a few scientists mentioned who are worth finding out a little more about. Surprisingly Brian Cox was only mentioned twice.
name a sport played with a ball;football;35;tennis;22;cricket;14;rugby;11;baseball;9;netball;7;NULL
name a type of seafood ;prawns;50;mussels;13;lobster;12;crab;11;clams;5;scallops;5;NULL

name a country starting with the letter A;Albania;25;Australia;24;Austria;22;Algeria;12;Argentina;12;Afghanistan;11;NULL

name a ride you might see at the fun fair;dodgems;50;ferris wheel/big wheel;27;waltzer;32;carousel;17;Roller-coaster/rollercoaster;15;ghost train;7;NULL
name an icecream flavour;vanilla;36;chocolate;20;mint choc chip;20;pistachio;13;strawberry;8;raspberry ;6;The last category just makes us feel hungry! If you said salted caramel, rum and raisin, banoffee, hazelnut, lemon, mango and raspberry or stracciatella find your nearest icecream vendor and give yourself a point. If you said Thunder and Lightning – thank you for introducing us to a new flavour – double jersey cream, cinder toffee and chocolate sauce – this sounds gorgeous!
